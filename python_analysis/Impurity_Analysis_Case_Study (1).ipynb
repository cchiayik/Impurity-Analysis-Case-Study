This discrepancy indicates that the global linear model, though acceptable at an aggregate level, fails to capture reactor-specific patterns—suggesting the presence of underlying non-linear dynamics, reactor-dependent effects, or missing interaction terms. These findings highlight the importance of granular model diagnostics in multi-system environments."
